          Aakarsh Singh (he/they) is a software engineer and new media artist
          hailing originally from India but now settled in the United Arab
          Emirates. They study interactive media along with computer science,
          art history and sound-music computing between New York University's
          Abu Dhabi, Berlin, and New York campuses.

        <p className="pt-4 pb-2">
          With their studies in Interactive Media, they work between virtual
          reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, sound-light
          installations, and inter-connected multimedia websites. They aim to
          explore post-colonial identity by delving into the recesses of memory
          - both personal and communal. This disintegration and fragmentation of
          memory is expressed in a visual style equally ephemeral, transient,
          and fractured.
