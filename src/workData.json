For example, to create the illusions of pearls I set up a billboard shader of flat circles which would track the rotation of the phone, hence giving the illusion of a sphere. After that, I had to write another shader that would mimic the refraction that a sphere does onto a flat circle by converting coordinates from world space to camera space and then passing the normal texture of a sphere into this calculation."

Informed by Hegelian notions of nature as the unfolding of absolute spirit, the installation transforms dissonant point clouds into a vibrant garden as you lift a teapot and slowly water a solitary plant. This act mirrors Hegel's concept of simultaneous negation and preservation. As you nurture, the garden blossoms temporarily, symbolizing life's transient beauty and echoing Hegel's thoughts on the evolving nature of existence. To enhance the experience, another participant can shine light with their phone's flashlight on the growing garden, illuminating the collaborative dance between light and life."

The first trigger is when the pot gets lifted up, a signal is sent to TouchDesigner spawning a new point cloud flower in the garden. This is done by a replicator system that instantiates a custom TouchDesigner component with random values (for color, size, position) that is linked to a new Geo node. Once you start watering the plant, the point-clouds start coming back together to form flowers by switching between two point cloud files. The photo-resistors are then mapped to the Bloom TOP, deciding the threshold of the glow depending on how much light the plant receives. The point clouds when dispersed are in constant noise based movement, along with the camera. Future implementations of this installation in a bigger room, would involve tracking camera and motion to the movements of the crowd."

Through the haunting drones brought forward from the exploration of the slow loss of his hometown, I bring forward imagery of a frigid mountainous landscape going through deterioration and decay.  A descent into a foggy lake with fossils and lotuses, a first-person experience of disassociation of the land beneath, and a closing shot of the gradual collapse of the landmarks, work together to tell this story of postcolonial decay."

These themes are countered by conceptual reversal with the dissolved bodies coming back together or breaking free.
